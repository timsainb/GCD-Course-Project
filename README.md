## Intro

This is the course project for timsainb, for the Getting And Cleaning Data course on Coursera

## Raw Data

The raw data was acquired from the folder 'UCI HAR Dataset', with proper description in README.txt in that folder

## Files

**run_analysis.R** contains the script used to process the raw data, into tidy data
**CodeBook.md** CodeBook.md - explain variables

## Analysis

**run_analysis.R** cleans data by stripping data to holding only mean and standard deviation information on variables, and sorting data by Subject and Activity. Further description of raw data, variables, and how these variables were obtained are available in /UCI HAR Dataset/README.txt
